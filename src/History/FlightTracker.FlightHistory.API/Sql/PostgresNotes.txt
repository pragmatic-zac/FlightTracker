Just a scratchpad for postgres stuff

Lots of enhancements could be made - doing this for real, I'd probably put this in TimescaleDb and maybe use PostGIS too
___________

Main table for flights

CREATE TABLE Flight (
	Id				SERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
	Hex				VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
	FlightNumber	VARCHAR(10)
)

____________

Leaving several columns off of this as this is just a proof of concept
Using REAL for the number columns gets 6 digits of precision, good enough for testing this out

CREATE TABLE FlightStatus (
	Id						BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
	FlightId				INT NOT NULL,
	BarometricAltitude		INT,
	GeometricAltitude		INT,
	GroundSpeed				REAL,
	Track					REAL,
	BarometricRateOfChange	INT,
	Squawk					VARCHAR(10),
	Latitude				REAL,
	Longitude				REAL,
	CONSTRAINT fk_flightid FOREIGN KEY(FlightId) REFERENCES Flight(Id)
)
